I created a customer support agent to help buisnesses to automatticaly reply to thier customers. 
firt i use watch emails as a trigger. then i split it into batches. then i add email classifier for classify emails based on thier category.
email classifier seperate emails based on they are support, refund, product queries and other categories.
i add  seperate agents to handle each kind of category like support agent, product queries handler angent.
then i connenct output to google sheets to store outputs.
then i created rag pipeline to give agents knowledge about aur buisness polices and term and services and many more things. related to our buisness.
then i give vecter store as tool for agent so it can get all information from our data base.
then i connect google sheet output to send gmail node so it can send email baaack to our customer


This agent save many hours of buisnesses to send mannually emails to thier customers. it i a great projects for alot of buisnesses.
